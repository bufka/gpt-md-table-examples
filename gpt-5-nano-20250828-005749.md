Notes:
- The second section enumerates all services outside the top 10 in strict descending order by their total counts, ensuring all 29 remaining services are included (Ranks 11 through 39). The last rank (39) corresponds to 39 total services overall.
- Summaries focus on the dominant fault patterns in each service to guide quick-hitting remediation and prioritization.

Recommended follow-up
- Correlate incidents across the top-10 services to identify common upstream actors (e.g., shared data stores, auth services, or gateway components) that could be driving concurrent spikes.
- For all high-count paths, establish or improve end-to-end tracing, strongly typed log schemas, and DLQ/runbook instructions to shorten MTTR and improve reproducibility of root-cause analyses.
- Consider a targeted chaos-test exercise on the top-5 fault-prone pipelines (data ingestion, token/auth flows, document processing, and transfer/orchestration paths) to validate resilience controls (circuit breakers, idempotence, backpressure, and retries).
