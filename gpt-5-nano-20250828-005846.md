Notes on top-10 actions:
- The immediate actions emphasize stabilizing ingestion/processing, ensuring idempotency, improving backpressure and circuit breakers, and enhancing observability (tracing, dashboards, DLQs).
- Additional context (time windows, deployments, user impact, external dependencies) is critical to pinpoint root cause recurrence and to validate fixes.
- Prevention focuses on architectural hardening (idempotency, DLQs, backpressure) and stronger data/process validation.

Validation and notes:
- The “outside top 10” section lists all remaining services in descending order by their total counts and provides a concise, issue-focused summary for each. This ensures every service from 11 through 39 is accounted for and that the last rank’s count matches the 39th service count (1 for `crypto-kapec`).

Summary of recommended actions (overall):
- Prioritize stabilization of high-volume top-10 paths first, then address patterns in the 11–20 range where systemic issues (backpressure, reliability, and idempotency) begin to show.
- For each service family, implement a standard hardening playbook:
  - Enforce idempotent writes and deduplication where applicable.
  - Introduce or tune circuit breakers and backpressure.
  - Improve DLQs and automated remediation for recurring failures.
  - Strengthen end-to-end tracing and cross-service visibility.
  - Validate schema/format integrity early in the pipeline to prevent cascading failures.
- Align incident response with deployment windows and changes; ensure cross-team ownership mapping so fixes are verifiable in a controlled window.
- Build dashboards focused on:
  - Ingestion/processing latency and throughput
  - DLQ depth and retry counts
  - Error-rate per critical path
  - External dependency latency

If you want, I can convert these findings into a slide-ready summary or tailor the action plans to specific on-call playbooks and escalation paths.
