**Notes on top-10 findings and recommended immediate actions:**
- The top service, `orion-analytics`, shows overwhelming dominance of data quality and query-pattern failures; prioritize data ingestion integrity and schema drift checks.
- Several top services (e.g., `apollo-gateway`, `atlas-directory`, `sentinel-guardian`, `sigmal-sync`, `rampage-core`) exhibit core pipeline or integration reliability issues (handshake/buffer, provisioning loops, signing/credit/payment flows). Addressing those with idempotency, backpressure, circuit breakers, and DLQ/resilience will likely yield the largest stability gains.
- For all top-10 services, ensure there is a clear owner, a defined rollback window, and a plan to run targeted healthchecks after applying fixes.

Notes:
- The “outside top 10” list includes 29 services (11 through 39). The table above presents each with a concise summary of the primary issue pattern observed beyond the top-10 cluster.
- Where possible, align remediation with the same themes as top-10 services: enforce idempotency, improve backpressure and circuit breakers, strengthen DLQ handling, and improve monitoring/traceability to rapidly detect regression.

Immediate Next Steps (overall)
- Convene a coordinated stability review focused on top-6 risks: orion-analytics, eclipse-marketing, apollo-gateway, atlas-directory, sentinel-guardian, and comet-stream.
- For each, establish a 24- to 72-hour stabilization plan with concrete owners, success criteria, rollback plans, and DLQ/backup paths.
- Augment monitoring with synthetic checks targeting the top failure patterns (data glitches, handshake/buffer issues, provisioning jitter, signing/transaction path reliability).
- Validate post-fix health: ensure the top-10 counts show improvement or stabilization and confirm no new high-impact patterns emerge in the lower-ranked services.
