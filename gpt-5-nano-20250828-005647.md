Notes and guidance:
- The top 10 list is strictly based on the total counts provided. Counts match exactly between the top-10 listing and the per-service totals.
- For the top 10, the “Key Issues Identified” field is a synthesis of the most frequent patterns and their likely impact on service health and data integrity.
- “Immediate Actions” focus on rapid containment, triage, and starter remediation steps. They assume on-call/SRE availability and coordination with platform teams.
- “Additional Context Needed” highlights what kind of information or events would help resolve underlying causes (recent deploys, correlated failures, load spikes, or external dependencies).
- “Prevention Measures” propose long-term mitigations to reduce recurrence, including architectural, operational, and observability improvements.
- The second section ensures all remaining services (11–39) are listed with a concise summary to avoid omissions and to enable cross-service trend detection.

If you want, I can convert these actions into a prioritized runbook with owners and suggested time targets (e.g., 0–15 min initial triage, 1–3 hours containment and patch, 24–48 hours verification).
