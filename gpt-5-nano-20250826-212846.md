Notes and context:
- Total unique services in the dataset: 39. Top 10 services above represent the largest counts and are the priority for immediate triage.
- If you need, I can break down the top issues by time window (e.g., last 24h, 7d) to identify surge patterns or correlate with deployments.

Preventive measures (shared and per-service, applicable across the top 10 and beyond):
- Implement global correlation IDs and distributed tracing across all services to quickly pinpoint root causes.
- Enforce idempotency in all critical paths (especially payments, transfers, signing, directory provisioning, and campaign data flows).
- Strengthen back-pressure, circuit breakers, and rate limiting for high-volume gateways and streaming paths (gateway, analytics, marketing, stream).
- Improve DLQ, retry policies, and safe, bounded retries with exponential backoff to prevent cascading failures.
- Centralize error taxonomy and standardize runbooks for common failure patterns; automate initial triage checks.
- Increase test coverage for high-risk flows (data ingestion, document/statement pipelines, financial processing, signing).
- Regular chaos/inject tests on critical paths to validate resilience under load spikes and partial outages.
- Enhance observability: unify dashboards for top error categories, per-service saturation, and latency hot spots; ensure quick drill-down capabilities.

Would you like me to generate a concise runbook snippet for the top 10 triage steps, or produce a time-bounded drill-down (e.g., last 6 hours) to identify recent spikes and correlate with deployments or traffic patterns?
